    <p id="about_details"> This is part of a fun hobby project. This project can be viewed as a low-key alternative front-end for Wikipedia which returns the summary of the search text entered by the user from     Wikipedia.
    An interesting feature called Trending shows the most visited Wikipedia pages globally in the last day. This gives an idea of what is capturing people's mind recently.</p>
