<h2>Introduction<h2>  
<p> <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is a online repository which has information on almost every topic. This Flask app uses Wikipedia API to get a search query from the user and displays a list of the reated topics. Once a topic is selected, the app then fetches the summary of that Wikipedia article and displays it.
The app also shows the most viewed Wikipedia topics in the past day along with the page views. These are hosted under the tab <b>Trending</b> on the navigation bar at the top.
